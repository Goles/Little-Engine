# FTGLES TUTORIAL

UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

The [Hello World Demo](http://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/blob/master/Demos/iOS/HelloWorld/Classes/Delegate.mm) example class shows a minimal implementation of a render loop in Objective-C.

See the [Demos](http://github.com/cdave1/ftgles/tree/master/iPhone/) folder for several comprehensive sample iPhone apps.  The demo apps include a unicode demo, as well as a demonstration of how to use layouts to easily align and position your text.
