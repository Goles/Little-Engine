The GGEngine (Good Game Engine) will be a modern multi-platform 2D Game Engine for mobile devices. It will focus on iOS compatibility, fast prototyping, delivering awesome development tools and will allow to easily integrate social networking platforms deeply in mobile games.

We want to provide a modern engine with a rich toolset to minimize the aforementioned issues, thus helping the Game Studios to focus on the quality of the final result by speeding up in-device prototyping and minimizing the time spent in the implementation and integration of low-level systems.
