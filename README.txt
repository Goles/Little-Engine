The GGEngine (Good Game Engine) will be a modern multi-platform 2D Game Engine for mobile devices. It will focus on iOS/Android
compatibility, deliver awesome development tools and will allow to easily integrate social networking platforms deeply in
mobile games.

The most popular mobile games today are 2D based, it's just a matter of checking out Andry Birds, Doodle Jump, Cut the Rope,
Tap Tap Revenge, etc. This could be because the 3D paradigm doesn't fit that well in today's mobile devices, or isn't the most
accepted among the consumers.

There are some 2D mobile Game Engines out there, but their main problems are the lack of cross-compatibility and the quality of
the development tools available for them. For instance, if the graphic designer wants to preview his new awesome 2D Zombie
Sprites in-game, he must wait until a developer helps him out. The same holds true for a musician that would like to test his
new Zombie-Killing audio track in-game, and iterate over it.

When it comes to real integration with social networks, most of the game developers use already available frameworks, but they
must usually perform heavy customization in order to have deep in-game Fabook/Twitter integration. For example, if we would
like to trigger in-engine events based on social actions like changing the game-state based on what friends does a user invite
in Facebook, it would usually requiere an in-house custom solution, slowing down the Game Development process.

Commercial and expensive 3D Game Engines do exist, and do provide development tools but at a high cost from the developer.
Given the characteristics of mobile development teams today, which are small by nature and a lot of times independent, they
can't really afford to invest in this kind of technology, and while they do provide good 3D development facilities, their usage
for 2D games is quite limmited.

We want to provide a modern engine with a rich toolset to minimize the aforementioned issues, thus helping the Game Studios to
focus on the quality of the final result by speeding up in-device prototyping and minimizing the time spent in the
implementation and integration of low-level systems.
